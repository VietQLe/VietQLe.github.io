                    <p>I have 10 years of customer support for Nordstrom so making customers happy is my bread and butter.
                    I am very motivated to change careers from customer support and have a desire to become a professional developer.
                    I have dedicated the last year to this move by taking a class with General Assembly, going through online tutorials, and working on whatever freelance projects I can find.
